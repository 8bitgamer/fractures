Baseline atomic CSS toolkit.

Fractures helps you bootstrap design-systems and prototypes by providing a set of non-blocking, atomic, utility classes.

Goals:
- You can design with &mdash; not around it. Leaves UI untouched.
- Atomic, non blocking.
- Managable cognitive load, with a small footprint.
- Fast in every way.
- Framework agnostic.
