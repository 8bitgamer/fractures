The baseline atomic CSS toolkit.  
[Demo.](http://fractures.space)


*Fractures helps you bootstrap design-systems and prototypes by providing a set of non-blocking, atomic, utility classes.*


Goals:
- You can design with â€” not around it. Leaves UI untouched.
- Atomic, non blocking.
- Managable cognitive load, with a small footprint.
- Fast in every way.

Notes:
- Blocks are built on a 8px scale &ndash; you can overwrite this in src/variables.
- It also soft resets HTML elements and sets a basic typescale, which can be adjusted by setting the body font.
